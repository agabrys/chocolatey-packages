# Selenium Gecko Driver
[![Selenium Gecko Driver](https://img.shields.io/badge/chocolatey-selenium--gecko--driver-brightgreen.svg)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/selenium-gecko-driver/)

Proxy for using W3C WebDriver-compatible clients to interact with Gecko-based browsers.

This program provides the HTTP API described by the [WebDriver protocol](http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#protocol) to communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox.
It translates calls into the [Marionette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette) automation protocol by acting as a proxy between the local- and remote ends.

You can consult the [change log](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for a record of all notable changes to the program.

`geckodriver.exe` file is located in `<Get-ToolsLocation>/selenium` directory.
